# Project 1: Relational Algebra

## Overview

In this section, we will introduce how relational databases represent and process the concept of "data". In the SQL syntax section, we will introduce SQL from an abstract perspective, focusing on experience and operation; in the Table codec section, we will introduce how to map data to storage - that is, to TinyKV; then, we will explain in detail the relational algebra model and detailed definitions of common SQL syntax

## Rating

Since the first part of the assignment is a test for another platform, the Project 1 score is the grade for the second part of the assignment. Part III is for supplementary learning only.
